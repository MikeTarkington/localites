Scoutr is a decoupled application that uses React Native on the front-end, and Rails 5 on the back-end.

The back-end is deployed to Heroku to serve data by managing relevant content in a PostgreSQL database and handling Yelp API calls, but it is also ready to be developed as an independent Rails web app.
